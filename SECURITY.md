## What is a Security Vulnerability?

A security vulnerability is a flaw or weakness in a system's design, implementation, operation, or management that could be exploited to violate the system's security policy. (Source: OWASP)

Please note that we will not accept reports related to vulnerabilities in other software, such as dependencies. Additionally, we reserve the right to close reports that describe scenarios deemed highly unlikely or far-fetched.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues very seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it through our private reporting form: [Report a Security Vulnerability](https://github.com/bruits/graphgarden/security/advisories/new).

### Guidelines for Reporting

- Do **not** report vulnerabilities publicly via issues or discussions.
- Please provide as much detail as possible about the vulnerability to help us investigate and resolve it quickly.

### What to Expect

- You will receive an acknowledgement of your report within **48 hours** (working days).
